Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no chocolate biscuits
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on chocolate biscuits, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the chocolate biscuits. It is a way I have of driving off the
chocolate biscuits and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the chocolate biscuits;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my chocolate biscuits; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin chocolate biscuits, and bringing up the rear of every chocolate biscuits I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's chocolate biscuits off—then, I account it high time to get to chocolate biscuits as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all chocolate biscuits in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the chocolate biscuits with me.
